| `doge-*.js`       | Component      | The crux of your component.  The home of your logic, markup and styles*.  This file becomes accessible at fetch.dogecoin.org/your-component.js                                                                                                              |
| `initial.css`     | Initial Styles | Custom elements are prone to suffering a flash of unstyled content. You can reduce this by setting styles such as an initial height, width and display ruling to your element which are applied until your component is mounted (or "defined" in CSS speak) |
| `test.html`       | Tests          | A solid component for the community has tests. The more the merrier but test the important bits first.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `demo/index.html` | Demo Directory | A place for you to show off your component. What does it do, how does it work? This becomes accessible at fetch.dogecoin.org/your-component                                                                                                                 |
